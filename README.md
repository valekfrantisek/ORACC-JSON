 # ORACC-JSON
 
This repository contains [Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html) that allow you to download JSON-format files from the [Open Richly Annotated Cuneiform Corpus](http://oracc.org) and parse those for use in computational projects such as Social Network Analysis or various types of Computational Text Analysis. The JSON files contain editions (transliterations) with lemmatization of ancient texts in Sumerian, Akkadian, and other cuneiform languages from the Ancient Near East.

The Notebooks were written by Niek Veldhuis, UC Berkeley, and may be freely downloaded, used, altered and distributed.

This version presents updates to Niek Veldhuis's work by František Válek, University of Pardubice, and may be freely downloaded, used, altered and distributed.
It is particularly intended to provide further intertextual analyses on the ORACC corpus.
